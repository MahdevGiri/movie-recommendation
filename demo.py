Demo script for the Movie Recommendation System

This script demonstrates various features of the recommendation system by
running through different scenarios and showing the results. It serves as
both a testing tool and a showcase of the system's capabilities.

The demo covers:
- Basic system functionality and data statistics
- Collaborative filtering recommendations
- Content-based filtering recommendations
- Popular movies ranking
- Genre-based browsing
- Hybrid recommendations
- User rating histories

Each demo function shows realistic examples and explains what the system
is doing behind the scenes.
